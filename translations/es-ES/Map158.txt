horror~!"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"Fear is one of the principal emotions humans can feel and 
it has been very much necessary to our survival since the
dawn of time."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"The feeling of fear shows its beautiful head in situations 
where survival or personal goals might be compromised."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"The threat might be either physical or mental in its form."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"Physical threat is often more straightforward and its 
usually directly linked to our survival. Or it might
otherwise be a more concrete obstacle."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"Whereas mental/psychological fear deals with the possible
loss of our social roles, destruction of our identity or
seclusion from the communities we associate ourselves in.
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"One of the core elements of fear is the feeling of disgust
or a possibility of contamination."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"As examples - A physical fear of contamination might come
from things that are rotten andor alien to us, where there
is a chance for diseases or it otherwise risks our survival."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"And psychological contamination might be something that
causes moral decline or corruption in us."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"Oh~ One thing to note!"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"Of course in this talk it's easy to mix the psychological
fear with what is considered psychological horror in books
and novels."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"That term refers more to how those previously mentioned
forms of fear are suggested on a psychological level."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"In horror it doesn't exclude either of the forms. Getting
confused haha?"
