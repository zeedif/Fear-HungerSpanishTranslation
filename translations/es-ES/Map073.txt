valuable lessons.
____TEXT____
You learn \c[2]Lockpicking\c[0].
____TEXT____
You struggled through your early life, but managed to get
by as a merchant of sorts. Your skills of haggling and
speech improved over the years and you also managed to
gather some savings.
____TEXT____
You get \c[2]30 Silver coins\c[0].
____TEXT____
However your endless soul yearned for more...
You couldn't just become a family man, grow fat and make
a living as a mere merchant. You were destined for more.
____TEXT____
As you grew older you took part in various mercenary armies
and learned the dirtiest tricks to stay alive. You were taken
in by a notorious veteran highwayman and you joined his little
band of criminals and ex-soldiers.
____TEXT____
During one of your many raids, your brigade got ambushed.
The odds were seriously against you. You could have just 
abandoned your comrades and kept you life, or you could have
fought to your last breath...
___CHOICE___
Abandon your comrades
Fight to the last breath
____TEXT____
You learn \c[2]Escape plan\c[0].

ones.

You get \c[2]30 Silver coins\c[0].
____TEXT____
You travelled across the land in your raids and eventually
settled down in the Kingdom of Rondon where silver was
loose as long as you were up for getting your knife dirty.
____TEXT____
One day you got an ominous task from the officials of the
kingdom. You are to be paid well in silver if you get a
captain of a fabled mercenary army out of the dungeons
of Rondon itself.
____TEXT____
From the dungeons of Fear and Hunger. The morbid place has
been used as a wartime prison by the kingdom and for some
reason they need an outside sword like yourself to infiltrate
their very own stronghold.
____TEXT____
Something is clearly not right about this mission and you
have felt nauseua since the the moment you agreed on the
job. But you are short on silver and the reward is all that
matters in the end.
____TEXT____
You spent your last night in the kingdom...

This really is your make-or-break mission. There is a person
back in the city relying on you to return with riches. You 
have heard rumours about this place and you are sure that
there are great treasures hidden somewhere in these ruins...
____TEXT____
So even if the mission was to go south for some reason,
you are not going to return empty handed.
____TEXT____
You were born with the soul of the tormented. You are
destined to struggle in every step you take in life.
Ultimately this makes you stronger physically and tempers
your iron will that rivals the will of the gods themselves.
____TEXT____
You had a balanced childhood in the city of Oldegård with 
both of your parents always present. Your father taught you 
in the art of war. The very first step was to choose your 
weapon...
___CHOICE___
Choose bow & arrows
Choose an axe and shield
____TEXT____
You get a \c[2]Short bow\c[0] and 5 \c[2]arrows\c[0].
____TEXT____
You get an \c[2]Axe\c[0] and a \c[2]Wooden buckler\c[0].
____TEXT____
Winters grew colder and summers shorter, which resulted
a great hunger in the north. The fine men of the Oldegård 
set sails to the unknown west in a desperate attempt to 
find food and riches to feed the people.
____TEXT____
You had grown into your manhood and boarded the ship.
After months of sailing, the sea saw no end and the crew
was struggling. Some laid weak under the deck while some
some embraced the cold dark sea.

sin...
___CHOICE___

You learn \c[2]Bloodlust\c[0].
____TEXT____
As if the trip wasn't gloomy enough, when you finally found
land it was something no one in the civilized world could've
ever imagined. From the far reaches of the world you found
the dark continent of Vinland.
____TEXT____
The continent had never been touched by a civilized man.
The land was tainted by ancient deities and gods you had
never even heard of. The things you witnessed there left a
mark in you that could never be washed away.
____TEXT____
Some of your comrades lost their minds while others tried to
pillage anything worthwhile before leaving the macabre place.

____TEXT____
You get a \c[2]Soul stone\c[0].
____TEXT____
Unfortunately the relics you brought from the trip tainted
you and you formed a Panophobia, a fear of everything.
____TEXT____
An ancient artefact was brought from the dark continent.
You knew it was a mistake, but the choice wasn't in your 
hands. You knew something bad would follow sooner or 
later...
____TEXT____
The bad omens would soon reveal themselves as sometime after
your return during one of your many hunting trips, you came
back to your village only to witness your worst fears come
to life.
____TEXT____
A mercenary army had raided your village.
____TEXT____
You witnessed your home village burning, your family slain 
and the artefact stolen. Those who survived the raid 
described the army and its captain.
____TEXT____
He was the famous captain from the fabled mercenary army
Knights of the Midnight Sun. You immediately packed and
left after him.

\c[2]2 Cloth fragments\c[0].
____TEXT____
You learn \c[2]Dash\c[0].
____TEXT____
You learned that the man has since been taken in to the
dungeons of Kingdom of Rondon. In to the notorious dungeons
of Fear & Hunger.
____TEXT____
You set your mind - You will kill everything that carries
a dark soul in the dungeons, you will have your revenge 
and the dark artefact will be yours again. There is no
other way.
____TEXT____
You were born with the soul of domination that makes
people around you bend to your will. You are a natural
leader, but you might often end up blind to self-criticism.
____TEXT____
If your birth sign wasn't enough to warrant a future of
greatness, you were also born into a wealthy noble family.
At an early age you were sent into training to become
a holy knight of Kingdom of Rondon.
____TEXT____
Training to become a squire was a harsh school that spared
no one. No matter if you were from a noble origin or not.
____TEXT____
A practice sparring match between you and a well seasoned
squire took place at the central training grounds.
____TEXT____
It is said that a fighter shows their true colours in their
first fight. This applied to you too. When you saw the
sword coming your way, you...
___CHOICE___
Quickly stepped aside and dodged it
Raised your buckler in defence
____TEXT____
You learned \c[2]Fast stance\c[0].
____TEXT____
You learned \c[2]Defence stance\c[0].
____TEXT____
As time went on, you proved out to be a gifted fighter and
a valuable asset to the kingdom. However...
____TEXT____
The Kingdom of Rondon claimed to follow the will of the
gods in its pursuits for more power. But all the rewards
seemed to fall into the laps of the elite and the noble
sitting comformtably behind the castle walls.
____TEXT____
Ruthlessly the kingdom would expand its reign.
Reducing the feeble citadels to ashes and blood stains.
Enslaving the poor women folk whilst every man is slain.
Only spare a child or two, that its legend may grow.
____TEXT____
Your devotion was shaken. You were all but ready to retire
from the army, but your family insisted - no, they demanded
you to stay as a holy knight or else you'd bring great
shame to their noble family.
___CHOICE___
Break ties with your family and run away.
Listen to your family and stay as a holy knight.
____TEXT____
At this point family ties weighted no more than strangers
you met at the dirty streets of Rondon. You completely cut
ties with your family without hesitation.
____TEXT____
Just as you were about to flee from the army, things took
an unexpected turn for you. You met a captain of a small
mercenary army who seemed to share the same ill-will towards
the Kingdom of Rondon as you did.
____TEXT____
You swallowed your grief and doubt and decided to stay as
a holy knight. In the end you could try to fix things up
from the inside, you figured.
____TEXT____
Your family gave you a gift of \c[2]20 Silver coins\c[0].
____TEXT____
Just as things seemed too dark, you saw light in the
darkness. You met a captain of a small mercenary army who
seemed to share the same ill-will towards the Kingdom of 
Rondon as you did.
____TEXT____
The common folk was starting to gather around the 
charismatic leader Le'garde, who shared humble origins 
similar to farmers and villagers alike. There was
definitely something otherworldy in his stature.
____TEXT____
Le'garde saw potential in you and with warm words, he 
almost seduced you to join his band of mercenaries. Thanks
to your rigorous discipline, you took a high position in
his army, in the Knights of the Midnight Sun.
____TEXT____
Your army was growing fast in both size and influence in the 
western regions. The Kingdom of Rondon would first use your 
services to their own benefit, but soon saw you more as a 
possible threat to their modern reigns.
____TEXT____
Something changed with Le'garde as well. He kept more to
himself and studied ancient texts and occult. He became
obsessed with some relics and artefacts that gave you ominous
feelings and terrible nightmares.
____TEXT____
Things would only spiral towards madness even more when
Le'garde decided to raid the northern capital Oldegård.
____TEXT____
Without a warning or negotiations, Le'garde killed everone
who stood in the way between him and this mysterious 
ancient relic.
____TEXT____
It was this small overblow that was enough of an excuse 
for the Kingdom of Rondon to turn common folk against 
Le'garde and justify his imprisonment.
____TEXT____
As the troops of the Rondon army marched towards your
clearly smaller army, you had to choose which position
to take in the coming encounter.
___CHOICE___

Spearhead the coming assault.

____TEXT____

____TEXT____
The Knights of the Midnight Sun lost the fight.
____TEXT____
Many of your comrades were slain, but you managed to escape
the battlefield.
____TEXT____
Le'garde was taken as a captive and to be used most likely
as propaganda.
____TEXT____
You knew you didn't have much time before he would be
sentenced to death, so you had to act fast.
____TEXT____
Even if it seemed like a suicide mission, you decided to
save Le'garde from the prisons he was held in.
____TEXT____
Before leaving for your desperate journey, you decided
to stock up on equipment and items...

____TEXT____

____TEXT____
The dungeons open before you... You won't leave the ruins
without Le'garde. One way or another, you two will be
reunited. Even if it requires you to give up on your own
principles.
____TEXT____
You were born with the soul of the enlightened. You are
always seeking restlessly for new knowledge and secrets 
hidden from the common folk.
____TEXT____
This trait started to show itself at a very young age as
you were chosen to become a dark priest upon the birth of
you and your twin sister.
____TEXT____
Typical to such occult rites, you were pitted against your
sibling with ritual daggers and challenged to fight each
other to the very last breath.
____TEXT____
Unfortunate for you, you were born with a fragile body
and your sister easily overpowered you and had her dagger
on your neck waiting for the final blow.
____TEXT____
She however showed mercy and withdrew her dagger. She
stepped away from you as your high priest masters glared
gleefully at the event unfolding before their very eyes.
___CHOICE___
Strike your dagger to her spine while she walks away
Accept your defeat
____TEXT____
You stroke your dagger to the spine of your sister and she
collapsed to the ground. The high priests seemed especially
pleased with this and prepared you for your ascension 
ceremony.
____TEXT____
In the ascension ceremony you were to resurrect your
deceased sister with necromancy and use her as a ghoul.
You did this and the cold corpse of your sister brought
a smile to your otherwise emotionless face.
____TEXT____
You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0].
____TEXT____
After your ascension to dark priesthood, you were to leave
the temple grounds and learn occult on your own in your
dark pilgrimage.
____TEXT____
The dark priests got no place for the weak, so you were
thrown down to an underground well. There you were meant
to quietly wither away. Instead you fed on insects and other
small critters that shared your fate down in the darkness.
____TEXT____
With time you learned to understand the language they
spoke. You learned \c[2]Mastery over insects\c[0].
____TEXT____
With the aid of your new slaves, you eventually grew strong
enough to climb up the well. You creeped upstairs to the
temple and noticed it was the night time.
___CHOICE___
Set the temple on fire and leave
Quietly leave and run away without revenge
____TEXT____
Vengeful in how you had been treated, you set the temple on 
fire, jammed the exit door so no one could escape and then 
ran away. Only muffled screams could be heard coming from
the temple.
____TEXT____
You learn \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
____TEXT____
You quietly left the temple area thinking that revenge
wouldn't solve anything. But in order to make sure you
survive on your own you took some precious books to secure
your wealth.
____TEXT____
You get \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1\c[0].
____TEXT____
After leaving the temple grounds, you vowed to become a
dark priest on your own merits and prove your fate wrong.
____TEXT____
When beginning your self-studies, you first had to choose
the god you'd dedicate your time to.

Pray for Sylvian
Pray for Alll-Mer
Pray for God of the Depths
____TEXT____
You travelled across the western continent, learning about
different gods, deities, blood magic and all known sciences.
Your studies didn't come without their merits. You were 
acknowledged by the top scholars of the modern times.
____TEXT____
You were finally granted a pass to the great libraries
of the Kingdom of Rondon. You now had the collection of
all known history and science at your grasp.
____TEXT____
You learned of a certain man who was propheticed to begin
a new era for mankind. A man meant for greatness. But why
would you need to share the spotlight of the gods with any
mortal man?
____TEXT____
Prophecies are only for those who are weak enough to bend
to their sorry fates. You need to find this man and learn
more. To your current knowledge, he would be found
imprisoned at the notorious dungeons of Fear & Hunger.
