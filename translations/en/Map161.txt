You escaped the dungeons of Fear & Hunger. Part of you still
doesn't believe this to be the truth...

You can still smell all the blood and the gore that seeps
through the seams of the ancient stone walls of the

\c[2]Kill_Switch-X\c[0]

The game was made with \c[2]RPG MAKER MV\c[0] that is
developed by \c[2]KADOKAWA\c[0] and \c[2]Yoji Ojima\c[0]. 
RPG Maker is published by \c[2]Degica\c[0].


Thanks to everyone who has been supporting the 
development of the game for the past two years. There 
are too many names that deserve a mention here that I 
would surely forget some important ones, so let's just 
not mention anyone. A perfect solution. No, but really, 
thank you everyone! The game wouldn't exist without you!

Special thanks to Youtube channels of \c[2]Neco the Sergal\c[0] 
and \c[2]RiskRim\c[0].


Thank you for playing!!
