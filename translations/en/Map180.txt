dawn of time."

____TEXT____
\c[7]Pocketcat\c[0]
"The threat might be either physical or mental in its form."
____TEXT____

"Physical threat is often more straightforward and its 
usually directly linked to our survival. Or it might
otherwise be a more concrete obstacle."
____TEXT____

"Whereas mental/psychological fear deals with the possible
loss of our social roles, destruction of our identity or
seclusion from the communities we associate ourselves in.
____TEXT____

"One of the core elements of fear is the feeling of disgust
or a possibility of contamination."
____TEXT____

from things that are rotten andor alien to us, where there
is a chance for diseases or it otherwise risks our survival."
____TEXT____

causes moral decline or corruption in us."

fear with what is considered psychological horror in books
