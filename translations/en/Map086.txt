____TEXT____
You escaped the dungeons of Fear & Hunger. Part of you still
doesn't believe this to be the truth...
____TEXT____
You can still smell all the blood and the gore that seeps
through the seams of the ancient stone walls of the
dungeon...
____TEXT____
You can still feel the gaze of the hundreds of past 
warriors sacrificed in the pools of blood, now left to 
rot...
____TEXT____
You can still feel the pressure of the never-ending
darkness that the underground caverns offered. You can
still hear the distant flapping of the wings...
____TEXT____
You still feel dizzy just imagining the rail tracks that 
lead poor souls deeper to the madness... All the way to
the altar of darkness... 
____TEXT____
You delved too deep, you know it yourself too.
No man could ever return from that deep...
____TEXT____
You take a one more look at the fortress just to make
sure you really did make it out...

You never escaped the dungeons of fear and hunger.
____TEXT____
Instead you chose eternal void and darkness as a new god.

____TEXT____
You defeated Le'garde, the propheticed one with delusions
of creating a new era with his godhood.
____TEXT____
After his defeat you wake up outside the vile fortress that
trapped you before...
____TEXT____
It all seems so hazy... Did all those events really happen?
____TEXT____
You can still smell all the blood and the gore that seeps
through the seams of the ancient stone walls of the
dungeon...

You can still feel the gaze of the hundreds of past

____TEXT____
You can still feel the pressure of the never-ending
darkness that the underground caverns offered...
____TEXT____
Scarred for life, you run away from the dungeon. Hounds
howl on your tracks, but you are way past fearing such small
dangers that dwell under the sun.
____TEXT____
Horrors of the past never leave you alone though. Every
night you wake up from restless dreams where you are
forever trapped in the bloody corridors of the dungeon...
____TEXT____
The dreams become more and more lifelike as time goes on,
until you cannot tell the difference between a lucid dream
and the real world.
____TEXT____
In the end your fate was to dwell these dungeons forever.

____TEXT____
You left the dungeons. Contrary to all common sense, you 
made it out alive.
____TEXT____
Your return to the civilization would go without festivity. 
You were back to the square one essentially. Your long 
journey to the black gained you nothing.
____TEXT____
The only thing you brought with you was the bigger 
understanding of all the darkness this world hid beneath 
the human eyes.
____TEXT____
Not a day would pass by that you didn’t curse this 
knowledge. Just the idea drove you towards madness with 
each passing day.
____TEXT____
After several years living in seclusion, you started hearing 
rumours about the return of the Knights of the Midnight Sun 
and their now legendary captain Le’garde.
____TEXT____
This man with a mysterious aura was unifying the western 
world at a rapid rate. It’s almost as if the gods 
themselves were on his side. Choosing the right side of the 
coin at every possible turn.
____TEXT____
Eventually and inevitably he was throned as the Yellow King 
and he would bring prosperity to the western world. The 
kind that had never been seen before.
____TEXT____
You were never fully convinced however. The name ”Yellow 
King” left you puzzled and something about his campaigns 
gave you uncanny feelings.
____TEXT____
On your older days, in the Kingdom of Rondon, you finally 
caught a glimpse of Le’garde after multiple decades had
gone by since you two departed your ways.
____TEXT____
You finally understood where the name ”Yellow King” came 
from.
____TEXT____
Le’garde still looked the same age. Almost exactly like 
you remembered. The only difference was his sickly yellow 
skin coloured by the dark green hue of the endless void.
____TEXT____
He was not a human. This was not man taking reigns to 
themselves from the gods. This was something entirely 
different.

You never escaped the dungeons of fear and hunger.
____TEXT____
No one ever heard about you again. Without a trace you
vanish from this world.
____TEXT____
It's almost as if you fell out of history books altogether.
Your screams of terror never reached anyone.
____TEXT____
You long quest only gave you hints about the greater scheme
of things. You learned a fraction of the secrets the ancient
world holds...
____TEXT____
But even that is more than what is meant for human ears.

____TEXT____
Your efforts would go unsung, but your part in the greater 
scheme of things was vital nevertheless.
____TEXT____
You had a vital part in the birth of a new god.
____TEXT____
One that is not a mere new god but one that rivals the 
older ones.
____TEXT____
You had the first hand experience of witnessing the coming 
paradigm shift the world is to go through in the new era.
____TEXT____
An era of the newborn god, the god of fear and hunger.
____TEXT____
They'll come know this day as the cruel age.
____TEXT____
An age where a humanborn god would finally rise after 
millenias of mankind’s struggle as the feeble new gods.
____TEXT____
Maybe your fate was an act out of mercy? The last traces 
of compassion the newborn god shed after her true ascension.
Your demise was peaceful after all...

You could not save your loved one from the cruel fate the
dungeons had ready for him, but you succeeded in the next
best thing - resurrecting Le'garde.
____TEXT____
He shed his human skin, mocking his past existence as a
mortal.
____TEXT____
Apparently whatever he went through after his passing had
changed the man completely.
____TEXT____
You didn't mind his changed looks, but mentally he was
someone else as well.
____TEXT____
He had turned into a beast, craving to unleash the terror
and suffering he experienced to the outside world.
____TEXT____
The man claimed to have risen to godhood, but as you examined
his behaviour as a warlord, he resembled more of a 
bloodthirsty ghoul...
____TEXT____
Still, you were reunited with your loved one. That was all
that mattered to you. Maybe with his new crude looks and
way of thinking, he could finally be just yours completely?

You managed to escape the dungeons of Fear & Hunger alive.
It is a feat unheard of before. Not only that, you also
managed to find valuable loot that would guarantee a wealthy
future.
____TEXT____
The long journey back to the civilization felt like a 
lifetime. You could not sleep as you constantly felt eyes
lurking in the shadows of the night.
____TEXT____
The darkness, even though it was lighter than anything
you experienced in the dungeons still sent shivers down
your spine.
____TEXT____
As you finally found your way to the Kingdom of Rondon,
everything felt unreal. You could not understand how people
would lead their everyday lives simultaneously as a great
evil existed beneath their feet.
____TEXT____
You sold the ancient crown to the highest bidder. The 
amount of silver you got from it exceeded your expectations 
greatly. You also felt better getting rid of such unholy
artefact, as it kept reminding you about the darkness.
____TEXT____
You rose from the lowest class scum to a noble is a 
heartbeat.
____TEXT____
You bought your wife free from the labor she forced to at
the red light district and settled down in a fancy manor.
____TEXT____
You got everything you ever dreamed of. You got most of the
noble families on a leash thanks to your great wealth. 
Taking any breadcrumb you threw at them.
____TEXT____
You were living in the most extravagant manor with your
wife with no seeming worry about the future.
____TEXT____
Still... You could not sleep. Every passing moment you
would be grabbing on the hilt of your sword and staring
at the dark corners of your room...
____TEXT____
... Just waiting for the inevitable.
____TEXT____
You knew that the darkness you witnessed would leave no 
survivors. It would still come for you one day.

____TEXT____
You got everything you came for. The captain of the cursed
mercenary army was dead. You got the unholy artefact back.
____TEXT____
You also made sure that the evil that lurked in the darkness
was vanquished. You slaughtered every single creature that
held true power in the dungeons...
____TEXT____
However, you know the darkness doesn't end to the dungeons.
You've witnessed the same evil in the far-away continent
of Vinland and that same corrupting force lurks in the every
dark corner of the world.
____TEXT____
It is restless and relentless.
____TEXT____
For you to stop it from spreading, you also need to be
restless and relentless.
____TEXT____
From the moment you escaped the dungeons of Fear & Hunger,
you dedicated your life in hunting down those that are
concieved by the darkness.
____TEXT____
You would hunt down all the macabre beasts that hid from
the eyes of the oblivious western world.
____TEXT____
The beasts would come to know your name.

____TEXT____
You set your foot to the ascended plane where you met the
reflection of yourself. A form that had taken a shape of
a new god.
____TEXT____
The reflection was what you were to become. You felt a great
lust for power take you over. It would have been so easy to
give in and learn secrets that are only whispered among
mortals.
____TEXT____
But you came prepared. You had been warned about the lust.
____TEXT____
You declined the godhood and managed to step out of the
plane that was coloured by the green hue that radiated 
from underground pits.
____TEXT____
It's not like your ascension wasn't without its merits even
if you withdrew at the last second. You saw the reflection
after all and understood its intents.
____TEXT____
With your newly found knowledge, you took the grand 
libraries of the ancient city to be your own.
____TEXT____
The library already contained more information one could
digest in multiple lifetimes, but lucky for you, you
discovered the secrets of a prolonged life pretty soon.
____TEXT____
You found out how the older gods had left this world long
time ago. You had taken care of the new gods that resided
in the city of the gods...
____TEXT____
You did not need godhood to chase after the true 
enlightenment. You did not need godhood to become the most
powerful mortal to exist.
