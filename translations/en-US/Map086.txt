____TEXT____
You escaped the dungeons of Fear & Hunger. Part of you still
doesn't believe this to be the truth...
____TEXT____
You can still smell the blood and the gore that seeps
through the cracks of the ancient stone walls down there...
It never leaves you, wherever you go.
____TEXT____
You can still feel the gaze of the dead following you.
The poor devils were sacrificed in pools of blood and gore,
now simply left to rot...
____TEXT____
You can still feel the pressure of the never-ending
darkness that the underground caverns offered. You can
still hear the distant flapping of the wings...
____TEXT____
You still feel dizzy just imagining the rail tracks that 
lead poor souls deeper into madness...all the way to
the altar of darkness...
____TEXT____
You delved too deep, you know it in your heart.
No one could ever return from that deep...
____TEXT____
You take a one more look at the fortress, just to make
sure you really did make it out...

You never escaped the dungeons of fear and hunger.

Instead you chose eternal void and darkness as a new god.

You defeated Le'garde, the prophecied one with delusions
of creating a new era with his godhood.
____TEXT____
After his defeat you wake up outside the vile fortress that
trapped you before...
____TEXT____
It all seems so hazy... Did all those events really happen?
____TEXT____
You can still smell all the blood and the gore that seeps
through the seams of the ancient stone walls of the
dungeon...
____TEXT____
You can still feel the gaze of the hundreds of past 
warriors sacrificed in the pools of blood, now left to 
rot...
____TEXT____
You can still feel the pressure of the never-ending
darkness that the underground caverns offered...
____TEXT____
Scarred for life, you run away from the dungeon. Hounds
howl on your tracks, but you are way past fearing such small
dangers that dwell under the sun.
____TEXT____
Horrors of the past never leave you alone though. Every
night you wake up from restless dreams where you are
forever trapped in the bloody corridors of the dungeon...
____TEXT____
The dreams become more and more lifelike as time goes on,
until you cannot tell the difference between a lucid dream
and the real world.
____TEXT____
In the end your fate was to dwell within these dungeons forever.

____TEXT____
You left the dungeons. Contrary to all common sense, you 
made it out alive.
____TEXT____
Your return to the civilization would go without festivity. 
You were back to the square one essentially. Your long 
journey to the black gained you nothing.
____TEXT____
The only thing you brought with you was the bigger 
understanding of all the darkness this world hid beneath 
the human eyes.
____TEXT____
Not a day would pass by that you didn’t curse this 
knowledge. Just the idea drove you towards madness with 
each passing day.
____TEXT____
After several years living in seclusion, you started hearing 
rumors about the return of the Knights of the Midnight Sun 
and their now legendary captain Le’garde.
____TEXT____
This man with a mysterious aura was unifying the western 
world at a rapid rate. It’s almost as if the gods 
themselves were on his side. Choosing the right side of the 
coin at every possible turn.
____TEXT____
Eventually and inevitably he was throned as the Yellow King 
and he would bring prosperity to the western world. The 
kind that had never been seen before.
____TEXT____
You were never fully convinced however. The name ”Yellow 
King” left you puzzled and something about his campaigns 
gave you uncanny feelings.
____TEXT____
On your older days, in the Kingdom of Rondon, you finally 
caught a glimpse of Le’garde after multiple decades had
gone by since you two departed your ways.
____TEXT____
You finally understood where the name ”Yellow King” came 
from.
____TEXT____
Le’garde still looked the same age. Almost exactly like 
you remembered. The only difference was his sickly yellow 
skin colored by the dark green hue of the endless void.
____TEXT____
He was not a human. This was not man taking reigns to 
themselves from the gods. This was something entirely 
different.

You never escaped the dungeons of fear and hunger.
____TEXT____
No one ever heard about you again. Without a trace you
vanish from this world.
____TEXT____
It's almost as if you fell out of history books altogether.
Your screams of terror never reached anyone.
____TEXT____
You long quest only gave you hints about the greater scheme
of things. You learned a fraction of the secrets the ancient
world holds...
____TEXT____
But even that is more than what is meant for human ears.

____TEXT____
Your efforts would go unsung, but your part in the greater 
scheme of things was vital nevertheless.
____TEXT____
You had a vital part in the birth of a new god.
____TEXT____
One that is not a mere new god but one that rivals the 
older ones.
____TEXT____
You had the first hand experience of witnessing the coming 
paradigm shift the world is to go through in the new era.
____TEXT____
An era of the newborn god, the god of fear and hunger.
____TEXT____
They'll come know this day as the cruel age.
____TEXT____
An age where a humanborn god would finally rise after 
millenia of mankind’s struggle as the feeble new gods.
____TEXT____
Maybe your fate was an act out of mercy? The last traces 
of compassion the newborn god shed after her true ascension.
Your demise was peaceful after all...

You could not save your loved one from the cruel fate the
dungeons had ready for him, but you succeeded at the next
best thing - resurrecting Le'garde.
____TEXT____
He shed his human skin, mocking his past existence as a
mortal.
____TEXT____
Apparently whatever he went through after his passing
had changed him...completely.
____TEXT____
You didn't mind the changes to his appearance,
but inside, he was someone else as well.
____TEXT____
He had turned into a beast that would unleash all the terror
and suffering he had experienced onto the outside world.
____TEXT____
The man claimed to have risen to godhood, but if you examined
his behavior as a warlord, you would see instead the methods
of a mad, bloodthirsty ghoul...
____TEXT____
Still, you were reunited with your beloved. That was all
that mattered to you. Maybe...in this new, cruel form
and persona, he could finally be yours completely...

You managed to escape the dungeons of Fear & Hunger alive.
It is a feat unheard of before. Not only that, you also
managed to find valuable loot that would guarantee a wealthy
existence back in Rondon.
____TEXT____
The long journey back to the civilization felt like a 
lifetime. You could not sleep as you constantly felt eyes
lurking in the shadows of the night.
____TEXT____
The darkness, even though it was lighter than anything
you experienced in the dungeons, still sent shivers down
your spine.
____TEXT____
As you finally found your way to the Kingdom of Rondon,
everything felt unreal. You could not understand how people
could lead their everyday lives heedless of the great
evil that existed beneath their feet.
____TEXT____
You sold the ancient crown to the highest bidder.
The bag of silver you got from it exceeded your expectations!
You also felt better after getting rid of such an unholy
artefact, as it kept reminding you of the darkness below.
____TEXT____
You rose from the lowest class of scum to nobility
in a heartbeat.
____TEXT____
You bought your wife's freedom from her masters in
the red light district and settled down in a fancy manor.
____TEXT____
You got everything you ever dreamed of.
Nobles and princes envy your wealth and vie for your favor, 
fighting over each tiny breadcrum you toss them.
____TEXT____
You live in the most extravagant mansion, happily married,
and it seems as though your life is finally perfect.
____TEXT____
And yet...you can't sleep. Every time you start to drift off,
you find yourself grabbing the hilt of your sword,
fearfully searching the shadows for the tell-tale movement...
____TEXT____
...just waiting for the inevitable.
____TEXT____
You know the darkness you witnessed would leave no survivors.
One day, it would come for you too.

____TEXT____
You got everything you came for. The captain of the cursed
mercenary army was dead. You got the unholy artefact back.
____TEXT____
You also made sure that the evil that lurked in the darkness
was vanquished. You slaughtered every single creature that
held true power in the dungeons...
____TEXT____
However, you know the darkness doesn't end to the dungeons.
You've witnessed the same evil in the far-away continent
of Vinland and that same corrupting force lurks in the every
dark corner of the world.
____TEXT____
It is restless and relentless.
____TEXT____
For you to stop it from spreading, you also need to be
restless and relentless.
____TEXT____
From the moment you escaped the dungeons of Fear & Hunger,
you dedicated your life to hunting down those that are
conceived by the darkness.
____TEXT____
You would hunt down all the macabre beasts that hid from
the eyes of the oblivious western world.
____TEXT____
The beasts would come to know your name.

____TEXT____
You set your foot to the ascended plane where you met the
reflection of yourself. A form that had taken the shape
of a new god.
____TEXT____
The reflection was what you were to become. You felt a great
lust for power wash over you. It would have been so easy to
give in and learn secrets that are only whispered among
mortals.
____TEXT____
But you came prepared. You had been warned about the lust.
____TEXT____
You declined godhood and managed to move beyond the plane
choked by the green hue that radiates
from the endless underground pits.
____TEXT____
It's not like your ascension was without its merits,
even if you withdrew at the last second. You saw your
reflection, after all, and understood its intents.
____TEXT____
With your newfound knowledge, you took the grand 
libraries of the ancient city as your own.
____TEXT____
The library already contained more information than one could
digest in multiple lifetimes, but lucky for you, you
discovered the secrets of a prolonged life pretty quickly.
____TEXT____
You found out how the older gods left this world long ago.
You had taken care of the new gods that resided
in the long-lost city of Ma'habre...
____TEXT____
You did not need godhood to chase after true enlightenment.
You did not need godhood to become
the most powerful being to ever exist.
