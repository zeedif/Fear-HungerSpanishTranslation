violent life as traveling mercenaries.

your masters, all while offering the opportunity
to travel the world and see its wonders.
____TEXT____
You remember... while coldly killing one of
your victims on a highway heist - you encountered
the wolf deity of those northern parts.

You remember your ancestors from a long line of noble
knights from the Kingdom of Rondon.
____TEXT____
You remember...how from a very early age, every single
one of your ancestors had to take the training to become
a holy knight of Alll-Mer.
____TEXT____
You remember...how the priests, your caretakers, would use
punishing and cruel ways to embed the moral codes
of the knighthood within you.
____TEXT____
You remember... how the cruelty knew no end. Every day you
would be pitted against beasts from exotic locations,
____TEXT____
while every night you would be pitted against the beasts of
the monastery, as the monks would creep into bed next to you
in the darkest hours of the night.

You remember the wicked rituals your ancestors performed.
Crude, old-fashioned witchcraft that lacked the
finesse of it's modern counterpart.
____TEXT____
You remember...how your ancestors would desperately try
to contact even the most minor demons in their attempts to
gain more knowledge of the other side.
____TEXT____
You remember...how from every generation, only the eldest
child would be chosen to continue the family name...
____TEXT____
...while the rest would be cut open and have their blood 
drained as a sacrifice to the old gods.
____TEXT____
You remember...after generations of these black arts, your
ancestors finally managed to summon a wretched little evil.

____TEXT____
You remember...how your father would look at you from the
dark corner of your small hut. The eyes of a starving man.
____TEXT____
You remember...how neither of you had eaten a thing in over
two weeks. How the hunger would drive even the most good-
hearted man insane.
____TEXT____
You remember...how your father finally made his move during
the full moon. But he was already so weak from the hunger...
____TEXT____
You remember... His feeble arms trying to wrestle you down.
But he proved to be the weaker of the two of you.
____TEXT____
You remember...the feast you would have the next day...
There was so much meat on the open fire that it could feed

This a book of various recipes from the famous 
Chef Andérs of the royal kitchen of Rondon.
____TEXT____
Even though the book claims to be a cookbook,
it seems to be more concerned with the notorious
Chef Andérs himself.
____TEXT____
It's more of a biography, and it greatly
exaggerates the triumphs and challenges he faced
as royal chef. There's even a nice little love story,
and with the princess of the court, too!
____TEXT____
Between all this romance and betrayal you find
recipes for chef Andérs' famous \c[2]Meatpie\c[0] and
\c[2]Vegetable pie\c[0]!

"Chained heart - by Ronn Chambara -
Silent grace in life, hid in your eye, in eyes
I used to dream of all night,"
____TEXT____
"Wasted tears weigh'in my back, from our love
of lies, lies - I used to stay awake every night."
____TEXT____
"Chains in my heart, gaining weight before your
eyes. Too heavy for me to bear, can't you see me
suffer?"
____TEXT____
"So hard to withstand, even the sight of your eyes,
the chains in my heart - so heavy - I can't defy..."
____TEXT____
You ponder these lines in your mind.
____TEXT____
"On the subject discussed earlier, in our last 
exchange - we no longer have need for those 
captives. What you do with those poor bastards is 
none of my concern."
____TEXT____
"If you do go with your wicked plans, please make 
sure you leave no one talking about 
the studies performed. No witnesses, so to speak."
____TEXT____
"Cruelty is not unheard in times of war. I'm sure
you, out of everyone should know this."
____TEXT____
"But some things exceed the limits any human should
ever experience. We do not want word getting around."
____TEXT____
"Take no insult in my words, but for my own sake too,
I hope I never hear from you again.
- Captain Rudimer"
____TEXT____
It's a list of inmates held captive here in these
dungeons:
____TEXT____
... You cannot make any sense of the handwriting.
____TEXT____
"Captain Rudimer - 5th of August, 1590 -
I've had feverish dreams for the longest time now. In the
dreams - the patterns on the walls, the cawing of the crows,
the swirling clouds. They haunt even my waking hours."
____TEXT____
"I haven't had a moment of tranquility in months.
It feels like the dreams have become wilder as the madness in
these dungeons grows ever stronger."
____TEXT____
"I don't know which is the result of which. Did the dreams
come before the madness, or are the dreams results of
the ever-growing chaos?"
____TEXT____
"Everything I see seems to remind me of the dreams'
otherwordly patterns."
____TEXT____
"I swear that yesterday, the intestines
of a gutted prisoner took that very same shape..."
____TEXT____
"But when I try to describe its organic, evershaping
pattern to scholars, or try to draw it on this very 
paper - I fail to do so."
____TEXT____
"Like a bonfire, with flames reaching out to the night
sky - so is its shape without a concrete form."
____TEXT____
"It's dangerous without a doubt. Effects like
these are far too much for mere humans to comphrehend.
I'm already overcome with obsession, so I know it better 
than most."
____TEXT____
"I know it better than anyone. Maybe I am the only sane one left
to acknowledge this? Is it my responsibility to clean up
everything myself once again?"
____TEXT____
"The crows - they give their testament to my suspicions."
____TEXT____
"I will start the purge. I will root out the madness.
Only I can do it."
____TEXT____
"The City of Ma'habre. You have seen it too, haven't you?
In your dreams you've wandered for lifetimes
with the silhouette of the city on the horizon.
____TEXT____
"You have seen the great towers that rise up
to the impossibly black night sky. Macabre obelisks,
whispering of some older, crueler age.
____TEXT____
"You have seen the grand gate, with its maddening
murals and spirals - patterns beyond understanding."
____TEXT____
"And if the sound of the wind howling through
those hollow streets wasn't enough..."
____TEXT____
"You've also heard the sound of local residents, haven't you?
Even though you know that this place
must be long-abandoned..."
____TEXT____
"...You still hear them, don't you? You are never alone there,
in that vile part of the world."
____TEXT____
"In your dreams you have seen it, haven't you?
The City of Ma'habre. The City of Gods."
____TEXT____
"But did you know that it still exists within our world?"
____TEXT____
"-Studies of Gro-goroth I-"
____TEXT____
"To give room for new generations, for new trees to
grow and propagate - the prior forest needs to be burnt down.
Such is the rule of creation."
____TEXT____
"Creation and Destruction, one does not exist without the
other. The destruction is called Gro-goroth, the destroyer 
of men."
____TEXT____
"Common men fear destruction, because they get accustomed
to peace and quiet. They grow fat and afraid of change."
____TEXT____
"But change is inevitable, just like Gro-goroth."
____TEXT____
"But there is no need for fear! The destruction is pure,
and does not target anyone specifically. It simply
-exists-"
____TEXT____
"Interesting note on Gro-goroth - he is of a curious kind.
More so than any of the other old gods."
____TEXT____
"To relieve our feelings of fear, Gro-goroth wears
the bodies and skins of men and women alike."
____TEXT____
"He might still be walking among us, masked by the
facade of hanging flesh, blessing us with his presence and
his powerful blood magic."
____TEXT____
"The fellowship chapter 1 -
The following pages tell of the events that took place
in the year 809 after the birth of our christ,
the ascended one."
____TEXT____
"The tale of the fellowship is familiar to many
but few know the factual story which all the
poems and songs are based on."
____TEXT____
"The fellowship consisted of 5 people:
Francóis - the dominating one,
Nilvan - the endless one,
Valteil - the enlightened one,"
____TEXT____
"Chambara - the tormented one,
and then there was the fifth one - one who never aspired
to the same greatness as the rest of the party - whose 
story bears no listeners. The forgotten one."
____TEXT____
"The fellowship was formed to seek the older gods,
they who had left humanity without guidance,
without aid in times of great peril."
____TEXT____
"The great kingdoms were slowly rotting away, and the grand
values mankind once aimed for were displaced by defiled
principles and practices."
____TEXT____
"Back then, there existed an old tomb that led to the
ancient city of Mahavre. The city worked as a hub for 
multiple different planes of existence. It was a place
where a man could meet his maker."
____TEXT____
"Those who set foot inside the city would be lost,
caught in the endless swirling dimensions
of the afterlife."
____TEXT____
"It is here that the fellowship would demand the
right of self-governance for mankind."
____TEXT____
"Freedom to choose our own destiny and build the future
we deserve."
____TEXT____
"The basics of Alchemy - Alchemillia vol.2"
____TEXT____
"The effects of different colored alchemic
substances are listed here:"
____TEXT____
"Red - Corrosive substance. Treat it with care."
____TEXT____
"Black - Growth hormone. Causes uncontrollable growth
in living tissue. Treat with caution."
____TEXT____
"Blue - Healing properties for muscle tissues."
____TEXT____
"Yellow - Protein-rich substance."
____TEXT____
"Recipes for basic alchemy:
Black + Oil = Highly flammable
Blue + yellow = Heightened senses"
____TEXT____
"Red + Yellow = Adrenaline boost"
Blue + Red = Poisonous effects
Blue + Purple = Antidote for the poison."
____TEXT____
"Prisoner from cell C1: She had beautiful skin.
I carved her curves open. She took pain surprisingly
well. When she asked me to stop, I cut out her tongue."
____TEXT____
"Prisoner from cell C4: Feeling aroused from the
earlier inmate, I inserted nails inside his male organs."
____TEXT____
"Prisoner from cell A2: He can't take manymore
sessions with me. Whatever I did, he remained distant."
____TEXT____
"Captain Rudimer took my big war criminal deeper below.
I got the feeling that high priestess Selene wants to have her
way with that beautiful man."
____TEXT____
"Of course, Captain Rudimer is completely oblivious to this.
I'd tell him, but I'm not exactly his trusted adviser.
He doesn't believe anything I say. He's under the impression
that I'm a complete savage who has lost his mind. Oh well."
____TEXT____
"-Studies of Alll-mer I-"
____TEXT____
"His origin was a humble one.
The seed of a false god laid down in a virgin mother - a god"
____TEXT____
"walking amongst men. Alll-mer would gather
12 apostles from his most trusted companions.
Together they were to bring back the old world order."
____TEXT____
"The kings and sultans of the time would not stand idle
while a man of undeniable god-like posture came down to
their golden city gates."
____TEXT____
"Instead they would capture Alll-mer. The newborn god
would be nailed onto a cross, arms spread wide, and be 
left for the crows to feast on."
____TEXT____
"But Alll-mer was to ascend. Arms still wide spread from
the cross, he would soar. Becoming the symbol we know today.
Turning his tortured posture into something greater
greater. A symbol of hope and domination."
____TEXT____
"Spending three days and nights in the city of the gods,
Ma'habre, he then returned to walk amongst men. With his
mourning 11 apostles he murdered the jealous
kings and sultans - as was just."
____TEXT____
"Thus he brought back the old world order."
____TEXT____
"-Studies of Sylvian I-"
____TEXT____
"Sylvian is the goddess of love, lust, and creation."
____TEXT____
"She created men and women at the dawn of time. From the
very first moments, she loved her children greatly."
____TEXT____
"Over time, her love blossomed into a more obsessive form
and she would try to guide her children more and more."
____TEXT____
"Once she realized her children would never be able to
return the same amount of affection back to her, her love 
took a more twisted form."
____TEXT____
"Sylvian would shape mankind more to her liking and more
into her own image with her gift to humanity - love magic,
otherwise known as flower magic."
____TEXT____
"For a brief moment in ancient history, mankind fell into
a craze of fleshly delights, a synchronized mass
of naked bodies pulsating and wasting their days
in the throes of wild lust."
____TEXT____
"There are still cults dedicated to Sylvian to this day,
but many believe she left mankind behind long, long ago."
____TEXT____
The book radiates light in every color of the spectrum.
____TEXT____
You feel like your journey has just begun. As if your
whole existence prior to this moment was a dream
that you watched from above.
____TEXT____
You feel a perspective shift in your surroundings.
____TEXT____
As if everything is shrinking, or perhaps you're ascending
higher.
____TEXT____
You gain a better understanding of yourself. The link between 
your mind and your body has started its deterioration.
____TEXT____
You feel closer to enlightenment.

"-The Tale of the Pocketcat. Chapter I -
It was a rainy day in the countryside just north from the 
forest of Merwood."
____TEXT____
"Willem, the wildest child known in the town, would stare at
the rain drops behind the window screen."
____TEXT____
"His mother would warn him of going outside. During rain
decent boys would help their parents with various indoors 
tasks. Rain brings forth all kinds of dangers not otherwise
known to little boys."
____TEXT____
"Disregarding the warnings and without a worry in the world, 
Willem dashed through the bushes and ran deep in to the Merwood."
____TEXT____
"In the heart of the forest, all wet from the rain, Willem
heard slight panting noices from an overgrown grotto nearby..."
____TEXT____
"Cautiously Willem peeked through the leaves..."
____TEXT____
"He would not believe his eyes when he saw a finely dressed 
cat standing on two feet, twice as tall as Willem's father 
would be."
____TEXT____
"The cat's back was facing Willem. Its hand was moving
swiftly inside its pocket while the two big yellow eyes  
glee'd inside a burlap bag in great excitement."
____TEXT____
"Suddenly the hand movement came to a halt."
____TEXT____
"Even if Willem was well hidden behind the leaves - slowly 
the cat turned  eyes towards him."
____TEXT____
"In terror Willem ran as fast as he could towards his home!"
____TEXT____
"The two glowing yellow eyes of the cat haunted him all the
way to his home gates."
____TEXT____
"His mother was there to meet him by the front door.
'So you just had to go to the woods, did you?' - said
his mother."
____TEXT____
"'You saw something you shouldn't have, right?!' - questioned 
his mother. 'And how do I know this?'"
____TEXT____
"Willem's mother would go inside to get a little parcel with 
decorated wrappings."
____TEXT____
"'This appeared on the front door just before you came. 
It was directed to young mister Willem.'"
____TEXT____
"Slowly Willem unwrapped the decorated paper with small
mouse prints on it..."
____TEXT____
"Inside the parcel, there was catnip."
____TEXT____
"Captain Rudimer - 16th of January, 1590 -
Trorrtur once again went too far with his wicked methods.
The prisoner was but a child, but already he had to go through
so much torture that he shit himself more than he bled."
____TEXT____
"I must say - I'm afraid of Trortur to a certain degree. Sometimes
I think I would do this world justice if I just off'd him with
my blade."
____TEXT____
"Very few know, but Trortur used to be a famed holy knight
of Rondon back in the day. He was able to achieve great fame
at a very young age. But during our holy campaign against
eastern terriotories, he was captured."
____TEXT____
"Everyone presumed him as dead. He died as a war hero. He
should have died as a war hero. But 5 years later when we
occupied the eastern capital Jettaiah, we also found what was
left of Trortur."
____TEXT____
"He was but a shadow of his former self. A disfigured,
hunchback man with barely any resemblance to the great hero
so many adored. I am sure during those 5 years, he went
through every method of torture, he now puts to use himself."
____TEXT____
"Just to honor the memory of Trortur the White, I let this
monster live today. Although I see great contradiction in my
words here..."
____TEXT____
"Captain Rudimer - 30th of April, 1590 -
It was a mistake to take this position in these dungeons. It's
next to impossible to keep any kind of order among troops here."
____TEXT____
"There are powers at play here, that we as mere mortals,
cannot fight against. I've come to accept the madness. A naked
prisoner crucified on a sacrificial statue with his guts hanging
out? Just another day in the dungeons."
____TEXT____
"More and more troops commiting suicide every day? More
food for those left! Orders to let some cultists do their
wicked rituals here? Anything goes! All the gore and macabre
scenery has become trivial to me."
____TEXT____
"The High priest demanded that we give them our prized
prisoner, the captain of the mercenary army, Le'garde of 
the Midnight Sun."
____TEXT____
"I hesitated at first. After all his worth in propaganda
alone cannot be underestimated. But those priests somehow 
convinced higher ups of their ways."
____TEXT____
"Le'garde was transferred to the lower levels, below the
mines. I have no idea what is the purpose behind this,
nothing good can come out of it but orders are orders."
____TEXT____
"I feel bad for the poor man. It's obvious the kingdom of 
Rondon backstabbed him, just because he was gaining influence
at such a rapid rate. And now his story ends here, defiled
in some unholy practices."
____TEXT____
"In this book, I will recount what I learned at the Eastern
Sanctuaries with my late master Nas'hrah the great."
____TEXT____
"You see, I was given honor of being an apprentice to the
great wizard. My time with him was brief, and I only managed
to scratch the surface of the immense knowledge he posessed."
____TEXT____
"In this book I will list out the secrets and spells he spoke
of. On how to acquire the knowledge behind blood magic
and flower magic - You must seek that information elsewhere."
____TEXT____
"These were his words:"
____TEXT____
"I know of the 1st secret of Gro-goroth:
If I see, hanging from a tree a dead mans corpse, I wish
upon his soul and bind it back to their umbilical cord. And
then that corpse will walk and speak again with me."
____TEXT____
"I know of the 1st secret of Sylvian:
If I sprinkle my seed inside the womb of the freshly-deceased,
the life that is left lingering in that corpse will sprout
a son in my name. a son that will live a life of violence."
____TEXT____
"I know of the 2nd secret of Gro-goroth:
The miniscule world I have always felt curiosity for becomes
understandable to me. I am finally able to converse with the
insects around me and have them reveal their deepest secrets."
____TEXT____
"I know of the 2nd secret of Sylvian:
I no longer have to fear for separation from my loved ones,
for we can forever join in a marriage of flesh. An act of 
love that creates a beautiful union of two souls."
____TEXT____
"I know of the 3rd secret of Gro-goroth:
For all the wrong that they have done to me, I can merely
point my finger and unleash the violence at them in a
desperate cry of remorse."
____TEXT____
"I know of the 3rd secret of Sylvian:
As human beings are simple creatures guided by their feelings
and lusts, I can easily control their affections in the most
primal way."

"These are my studies over the subject of creation of an
artificial life form. Such ability transcends humanity and
the limits mankind has set itself."
____TEXT____
"During my time as a man walking amidst people, such studies
were frowned upon. The other scholars would bring such topics
as morality or ethics to the table."
____TEXT____
"But I believe this to be the final pillar we must overcome
in order to ascend to the true godhood. To be equals
with the older gods. Or even greater..."
____TEXT____
"The older gods have shown talent for creation of life,
since the beginning of time."
____TEXT____
"The animated clay figurines that inhabit Ma'habre are
a perfect example of this. They are just golems created for
physical work. Without rest, they carry on their duties."
____TEXT____
"The older gods would then create life for different purposes
whenever necessary. All this, I believe, eventually led to the
creation of the ultimate life form - the human being."
____TEXT____

I understand enough to be able to achieve this."

"I must achieve this. To be truly self-sufficient,

however. They are seemingly eternal beings. Only as they get
damaged over time do they eventually perish."
____TEXT____
"I do not believe my creations, my children, so to speak,
should ever outlive me, their creator. Their father."
____TEXT____
"That is why I decided to create the life form from the very
same fabric fragile humans were created from: flesh."
____TEXT____
"The silhouette of the form is very sturdy in order to carry
ou*t its working duties. I was able to combine existing materials
into one being, and my lifeform had gotten its shape already."
____TEXT____
"The hairiness is a side-product of mold. It doesn't serve
any obvious purpose, but I suppose it could keep the form
warm in colder climates as well." 
____TEXT____
"I was able to create this form rather easily and there
doesn't seem to be any immediate flaws in its design either."
____TEXT____
"Before going further with my studies, I decided to test
different approaches as well. Besides organic matter, I
decided to work on creating mechanical life."
____TEXT____
"Mechanical structures are far simpler than those created
from flesh, so the figurine was ready in just few years."
____TEXT____
"The figurine is not strong enough for physical labor nor
do I need another one for the same purpose, so I repurposed
them for my pleasure."
____TEXT____
"I have achieved all this in a matter of just a few years.
I can only imagine what I'll be able to achieve with the
eternity I have before me. --Valteil"

DISCORD
Starting the discord channel
\c[2]Jacob Hunt\c[0]
Moderator/dungeon master/general help
\c[2]Kill_Switch-X\c[0]

The game was made with \c[2]RPG MAKER MV\c[0] that is
developed by \c[2]KADOKAWA\c[0] and \c[2]Yoji Ojima\c[0]. 
RPG Maker is published by \c[2]Degica\c[0].


Thanks to everyone who has been supporting the 
development of the game for the past two years. There 
are too many names that deserve a mention here that I 
would surely forget some important ones, so let's just 
not mention anyone. A perfect solution. No, but really, 
thank you everyone! The game wouldn't exist without you!


SPECIAL THANKS
The chibi version of the Crow Mauler was based on fanart
made by \c[2]Vervain\c[0] @VervainVanity

The character Jeanna was based on orginal character by 
\c[2]Mom/Fern\c[0]

The character Seril was based on original character by
\c[2]Mask\c[0]

The character Isayah was based on original character by
\c[2]Kill_Switch-X\c[0]


Special thanks to Youtube channels of \c[2]Neco the Sergal\c[0] 
and \c[2]RiskRim\c[0]
