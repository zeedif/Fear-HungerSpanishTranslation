As time will pass, will you tell people about your monumental

Stories about your fabled endeavors are passed to people
of all ages. Your tales inspire many in the times to come
from children to elderly.
____TEXT____
Your story is left unspoken and unsung. There are rumors here
and there but for the most part, the era of the new gods
started diminish with your ascension.
____TEXT____
In the coming era, mankind is at the brink of chaos. Diseases
run wild and kingdoms wage war with hundreds of thousands
of casualties on all fronts, both women and children included.
____TEXT____
You would have the power to interrupt and potentially stop 
this. You have the strength to stop the mindless killing.
But that would require you to step out of the plain of this
void...
____TEXT____
Instead, you could try to affect mankind through religion
and beliefs. Affecting the whole culture means slow change
and its effects don't save those in immediate peril, but
religion might have more long-lasting effects.

Save mankind with your strength
Influece people through religion
____TEXT____
You leave your golden throne to disrupt the ongoing wars.
With overwhelming strength you crush entire armies that stand
in your way. Kings and sultans of the time are left in terror
before your power.
____TEXT____
Once you are done with your rage, mankind is left in a
state of chaos. Common people got no one to turn onto and
thus they seek safety from smaller tribes and communes.
____TEXT____
By meddling with mankind, you ended up halting the
technological and cultural progress. People are also less
self-imposed because of relying on gods in the past.
____TEXT____
The civilizations is back to iron age-like structure where
physical strength is the only thing that matterss.
____TEXT____
You watch other deities and gods fall around you one by
one as men revolt against old world order.
____TEXT____
However, your gospel back in the day was so strong that
people remember it loud and clear.
____TEXT____
Your legacy had only grown stronger with you crushing the
warring kingdoms before the chaos began.
____TEXT____
Men fear you.
____TEXT____
You are known as the fierce god and because there are no
other gods left to rival your power, you become the one and
only god despite your strength being limited to that of a
new god...
____TEXT____
The harsh times breed harsh men. Mankind is physically in
its peak condition because of the warring tribes.
____TEXT____
Because there is no centralized civilization, creating a
strong uniform religion proves to be difficult.
____TEXT____
With all new understanding of morals and customs, people
riot against the gods of older times.
____TEXT____
You manage to withstand against the oncoming forces for
some time but eventually among mankind there appears a
successor to your reign.
____TEXT____
You are beheaded and your mutilated torso is put on display.
You become a symbol of old and in this way you are remembered
even in coming centuries...
____TEXT____
Slowly in times of despair, people start to turn to your
religion in hopes for salvation.
____TEXT____
Many are killed and every new victim feeds the ongoing
plague and destruction. This age would be known as the dark
age in the history books, but your light would become an
important factor in the survival of civilizations.
____TEXT____
You are known to men as the merciful god. New deities and
false apostles rise as decades go by, but the foundation you
laid during the dark age made you the pillar of morals for
centuries to come.
____TEXT____
Even if your power is limited to that of the new gods, your
legacy would eventually rival that of older gods...
____TEXT____
Sadly only few people find their way to your teachings
because of your relatively less-known status.
____TEXT____
At best, you manage to form a cult around your religion. But
because anyone who follows you is condemned as heretic in
these times of great peril and prejudice, your followers
resort to dark arts and dubious methods in order to survive.
____TEXT____
Centuries later you still manage to hang onto your cult
status. However, generations of degenerative methods inside
your cult has lead it becoming very notorious around modern
religions.
____TEXT____
You are considered far from the most notable gods and
generally your followers are spit upon of the city streets.
____TEXT____
With your legacy dying, so does your strength. You are
dethroned as time goes on by the new generation of new
gods.

You are forgotten in the sands of time...
