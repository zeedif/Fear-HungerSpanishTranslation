this?"
____TEXT____
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]
"Such pure virtues couldn't exist here. This place taints
everything it touches..."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Le'garde\c[0]
"Do you think any of the grand kingdoms history books speak
of stand on pure foundations?"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Le'garde\c[0]
"They were all built on bloodshed and violence."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Le'garde\c[0]
"But what if there was a way that wouldn't require thousands
of soldiers on opposing sides shedding their lives?"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Le'garde\c[0]
"What if such a grand kingdom only required one soul to
succumb to the darkness. Only one soul to be tainted."
____TEXT____
\c[7]D'arce\c[0]
"...can anything so grand be built on rotten foundations...?"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]
"That's one flawed logic you got there Le'garde."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]
"The reason all those kingdoms in the past crubmled down was
not because of the lack of power or whatever, but because of
of that very same twisted logic you got!"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Cahara\c[0]
"Ends don't justify the means."

____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]

be a passage in the history books?"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"You fool! That is not the part of the new gods!"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"New gods in fact are just a creation of the rules of the
old. They are there to guide mankind like a cattle to the
slaughtering grounds."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"I'm sick and tired of hearing about the 'old world order'
and the 'new world order'..."

coincidence that we even exist, why would you try to control
our existence and put it under an 'order'?!"
____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"For mankind to truly be free from the reign of the older
gods, we must strive for chaos!"

As you get closer to the throne... You feel the air standing still.
You feel electricity and excitement radiating from the chair.
____TEXT____
Your heart is beating fast. It feels like the throne holds
considerable significance in the greater scheme of things...

\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"This is the throne to ascend and become a new god..."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"You could just sit here - Believe me, I wanted nothing more
when I first got here..."
____TEXT____
\c[7]Nas'hrah\c[0]
"But doing so won't change a thing."

____TEXT____
The throne of the new gods is sitting here, empty.
