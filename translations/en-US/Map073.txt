band of criminals and ex-soldiers.

One day you got an ominous task from the officials of the
kingdom. You are to be paid well in silver if you get the
captain of a fabled mercenary army out of the dungeons

From the dungeons of Fear and Hunger. The morbid place has
been used as a wartime prison by the kingdom and for some
reason they need an outside sword like yourself to infiltrate
their very own stronghold.

there are great treasures hidden somewhere in these ruins...
____TEXT____
So even if the mission were to go south for some reason,
you are not going to return empty handed.
____TEXT____
You were born with the soul of the tormented. You are
destined to struggle in every step you take in life.
Ultimately this makes you stronger physically and tempers
your iron will until it rivals that of the gods themselves.
____TEXT____
You had a normal childhood in the city of Oldegård with

find food and riches to feed their people.

land it was something no one in the civilized world could've
ever imagined. On the very edge of the world you found
the dark continent of Vinland.
____TEXT____
A continent never touched by civilized man.
The land was tainted by ancient deities and gods you had
never even heard of. The things you witnessed there left a

Unfortunately the relics you brought from the trip were tainted
and you became afraid of everything around you.
____TEXT____
One artefact taken from the dark continent was different.
You knew it was a mistake to bring along, but the choice wasn't 
yours. You knew something bad would follow sooner or 
later...
____TEXT____
The bad omens would soon reveal themselves, as one week after
your return, after one of your many hunting trips, you came
back to your village only to witness your worst fears come
to life.
____TEXT____
A mercenary army had raided your village.
____TEXT____
You witnessed your home burning, your family slain, 
and the artefact stolen. Those who survived the raid

You learned that the man had since been taken captive by the
King of Rondon. He was sent to the notorious
dungeons of Fear & Hunger.
____TEXT____
You set your mind - You will kill everything that carries
a dark soul in the dungeons. You will have your revenge, 
and the dark artefact will be yours again. There is no
other way.
____TEXT____
You were born with the soul of domination that
bends others to your will. You are a natural leader,
but are often blind to your own flaws.
____TEXT____
If your birth sign wasn't enough to warrant a future of
greatness, you were also born into a wealthy noble family.
At an early age you were sent away to become
a Holy Knight of the Kingdom of Rondon.
____TEXT____
The training was bitterly harsh, and spared no one.
It did not matter if you were of noble origin.
____TEXT____
A practice sparring match between you and a well-seasoned
squire took place at the central training grounds.

____TEXT____
You learned \c[2]Defensive stance\c[0].
____TEXT____
As time went on, you proved to be a gifted fighter and
a valuable asset to the kingdom. However...
____TEXT____
The Kingdom of Rondon claimed to follow the will of the
gods in its many campaigns. But all the rewards
seemed to fall into the laps of the elites and the nobles
sitting comfortably behind their castle walls.
____TEXT____
Ruthlessly, the kingdom expanded its reach.
Reducing feeble citadels to ashes and blood stains.
Enslaving the poor women, killing the men,
and only sparing children for sport.
____TEXT____
Your devotion was shaken. You were all but ready to retire
from the army, but your family insisted - no, demanded
you stay a holy knight, lest you bring great
shame to your noble house.
___CHOICE___
Break ties with your family and run away.
Listen to your family and stay a holy knight.
____TEXT____
You don't need your family. 
You realize they're strangers to you, and you cut
ties with your family without hesitation.
____TEXT____
Just as you were about to flee from the army, things took
an unexpected turn for you. You met a captain of a small
mercenary army who seemed to share the same ill-will towards
the Kingdom of Rondon as you did.
____TEXT____
You swallowed your grief and doubt and decided to stay
a holy knight. You could fix the army's conduct
from the inside, you naively thought.
____TEXT____
Your family thanks you with a gift of \c[2]20 Silver coins\c[0].
____TEXT____
Just as things seemed too dark, you saw light in the
darkness. You met a captain of a small mercenary army who
seemed to share the same ill-will towards the Kingdom of 
Rondon as you did.
____TEXT____
The common folk were starting to gather around the 
charismatic leader Le'garde, who shared their humble origin.
He was hero to farmers and villagers alike. There was
definitely something otherworldy in his stature.
____TEXT____
Le'garde saw potential in you, and with warm words, he
seduced you into joining his band of mercenaries.
Thanks to your rigorous discipline, you took a high position 
in his army, in the Knights of the Midnight Sun.
____TEXT____
Your army was quickly growing in both size and influence. 
At first, the Kingdom of Rondon hired your
band for their own ends, but before long, they saw you as
a possible threat to their sovereignty.
____TEXT____
Something changed with Le'garde as well. He kept more to
himself, studying ancient texts and the occult. He became
obsessed with relics and artefacts that gave you ominous
feelings and terrible nightmares.
____TEXT____
Things would only spiral further towards madness when
Le'garde decided to raid the northern capital, Oldegård.
____TEXT____
Without warning or negotiation, Le'garde ordered the attack.
All who stood between him and a peculiar, mysterious 
ancient relic were slaughtered.
____TEXT____
It was this final act that was used by 
the Kingdom of Rondon to turn the commoners against 
Le'garde and justify his imprisonment.
____TEXT____

clearly smaller army, you had to choose a position
to take in the coming encounter.

the battlefield.
____TEXT____
Le'garde was taken captive to be summarily tortured
and executed as propaganda for the state.
____TEXT____
You knew you didn't have much time before he would be
sentenced to death, so you had to act fast.
____TEXT____
Even if it seemed like a suicide mission, you decided to
save Le'garde from the prisons he was held in.

to stock up on equipment and items...

without Le'garde. One way or another, you two will be
reunited. Even if it requires you to give up
your principles...or your life.

You were born with the soul of the enlightened. You are
always seeking restlessly for new knowledge and secrets 
hidden from the common folk.
____TEXT____
You were born one of two twins, and recognizing an omen,
you were both chosen to become dark priests
at a young age.
____TEXT____
As part of an occult rite, you were pitted against your
sibling with ritual daggers and challenged to fight each
other to the very last breath.
____TEXT____
Unfortunately for you, you were born with a fragile body
and your sister easily overpowered you, her dagger
on your neck waiting for the final blow.
____TEXT____
She, however, showed mercy and withdrew her dagger.
She stepped away from you as your high priest masters glared
at the event unfolding before their eyes.
___CHOICE___
Strike your dagger into her spine while she walks away
Accept your defeat
____TEXT____
You struck your dagger into the spine of your sister and she
collapsed to the ground. The high priests seemed especially
pleased with this and prepared you for your ascension 
ceremony.

deceased sister with necromancy and use her as a ghoul.
You did this, and the cold corpse of your sister brought
a smile to your otherwise emotionless face.

You learn \c[2]Necromancy\c[0].
____TEXT____
After your ascension to dark priesthood, you were to leave
the temple grounds and learn the occult on your own
in your dark pilgrimage.
____TEXT____
The dark priests had no pity for the weak, so you were
thrown down an underground well. There you were meant
to quietly wither away. Instead you fed on insects and other
creatures that shared your fate down in the darkness.
____TEXT____
With time you learned to understand the language they
spoke. You learned \c[2]Mastery over insects\c[0].
____TEXT____
With the aid of your new slaves, you eventually grew strong
enough to climb up the well. You crept upstairs to the
temple and found it quiet as the night above.
___CHOICE___
Set fire to the temple
Quietly leave and run away without revenge
____TEXT____
Vengefully, you strike back at your caretakers. You set the temple on 
fire, jam the exit door so no one can escape and then 
vanish. Only muffled screams can be heard coming from
the temple.

You learn \c[2]Pyromancy trick\c[0].
____TEXT____
You quietly left the temple area. After all, revenge
wouldn't solve anything. But in order to make sure you'd

Your path forward had been laid.
____TEXT____
You get \c[2]Alchemillia vol. 1\c[0].
____TEXT____

Your studies didn't come without their merits. You were 
acknowledged by the top scholars in the world.
____TEXT____
You were finally granted a pass to the great libraries
of the Kingdom of Rondon. You now had the collection of
all human history and science at your grasp.
____TEXT____
There, you learned of a prophecy: a man would soon ascend,
signalling the birth of a new era for mankind. But why?
Why this meaningless mortal? What did the fates intend?
In the end, it hardly mattered.
____TEXT____
Prophecies are only for those weak enough to bend the knee
to the mocking fates. You will find this man and claim
